# üöÄ Day 1 of Internship at OctaNet Services Pvt Ltd: Building an ATM Simulation Program! üè¶üí°

Today's journey into the world of programming begins with creating an ATM simulation program using Python. This marks the first task of my internship, where I'm combining my coding skills with financial operations to simulate an ATM machine. Excited to kickstart this project and learn more about the intricacies of ATM functionalities!

## Key Highlights:

### Feature Frenzy:
- **Card Processing Simulation:** Mimics the card insertion process with a slight delay, bringing a realistic touch to the simulation.
- **PIN Verification:** Ensures secure access by prompting the user to enter a PIN, validating it against a predefined password.
- **Comprehensive User Menu:** Offers a range of options including balance inquiry, fund withdrawal, deposit, and exit.
- **Transaction Operations:** Allows users to perform withdrawals and deposits, updating their account balance accordingly.

### Coding Confidence:
- **User Input Handling:** Mastering the art of collecting and validating user inputs.
- **Control Structures:** Utilizing loops and conditionals to manage the flow of the program efficiently.
- **Error Handling:** Implementing try-except blocks to ensure robust and error-free interactions.

Similar to previous coding challenges, this task emphasizes foundational programming skills while incorporating practical applications. I'm eager to explore the functionalities of ATMs through code and enhance my programming expertise!

## üöÄ Project Overview:

### Objective:
Develop a simple yet functional ATM simulation program that allows users to perform basic banking operations like balance inquiry, withdrawals, and deposits.

### Features:
- **Secure PIN Verification:** Only users with the correct PIN can access the ATM services.
- **Balance Inquiry:** Users can check their current account balance.
- **Withdraw Funds:** Users can withdraw a specified amount, with balance updates.
- **Deposit Funds:** Users can deposit a specified amount, with balance updates.
- **Exit Option:** Users can exit the program gracefully.

### Technology:
- **Python Programming Language:** The core technology for this simulation.
- **Time Module:** Used to simulate the card processing delay.

### Impact:
Empower users to understand the basic functionalities of an ATM, enhancing their knowledge of financial operations and Python programming.

## üìù Requirements:

### Python:
Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. If not, download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Code:
Clone the repository and navigate to the task directory to run the program.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SantoshMalhi/OctaNet-Internship-Tasks.git
cd OctaNet-Internship-Tasks/Task01-ATM-Simulation
python atm_simulation.py
```

## üìä Output:

### Program Output:
- Simulates card insertion.
- Prompts for and verifies PIN.
- Displays a menu with options to check balance, withdraw, deposit, and exit.
- Updates and displays balance after transactions.
